Description:

Splash~N~Dash, is a tiolet share/locator application that works similarly to such apps as AirBnB, Uber and Lyft. Unlike other bathroom locator applications that help you find the closest public restroom to your current location. Our application gives you the ability to locate a tiolet near you that another member is willing to let you use for a small nominal fee. In addition to just a toilet to use the host has the ability to provide other ammenities as they see fit. Such as luxuary hand soaps, towels, bidets, colognes and perfumes etc, etc. In fact some members are even willing to let you use their showers as well, imagine you have a blind date after work and dont have time to drive all the way home to clean up for the evening, just jup on the Splash~N~Dash app and locate a member near you that will allow you to use their facilities, saving you time and gas money.
